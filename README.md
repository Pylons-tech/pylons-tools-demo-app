# pylons-tools-demo-app

## To play:

1) Have the Pylons CLI installed
2) 
```
cd cmd/pylons_tools_demo_app
go build
```
3) run the executable you built in a terminal; provide it the name of a local keypair when prompted.

If it crashes, drop the error in the Discord thread; this is a super brittle application that hasn't been tested in a wide variety of environments.
